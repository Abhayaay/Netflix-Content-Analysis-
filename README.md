# Netflix-Content-Analysis-
Project Overview
This project explores Netflix's content trends using SQL and Tableau. The dataset includes information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix, covering details such as release year, country of origin, genre, rating, and content type.

Through data analysis and visualization, we aim to uncover insights like:

Which countries produce the most unique Netflix content?
What are the most popular genres?
How has Netflix’s content library grown over the years? etc. 
We use SQL for data preprocessing and Tableau for visualization to present these insights in an interactive dashboard.

## Key Insights
1. Diverse Content by Country – The USA, India, and the UK produce the most unique genres, while South Korea and Japan are rising with niche content.

2. Genre Trends & Peak Years – Dramas, Comedies, and Action dominate; highest movie additions happened in 2019-2021, driven by the streaming boom.

3. Shifts in Movie Production – While Netflix aggressively expanded its content library until 2020, recent years indicate a more focused approach, emphasizing original productions and regional content.
